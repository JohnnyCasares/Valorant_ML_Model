# ML model to predict Valorant match outcome

## Introduction
The Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for my project.
## Report
Check out the full report on the model
[report file](https://github.com/JohnnyCasares/Valorant_ML_Model/blob/main/Final%20report%20Johnny%20Casares.pdf)

## Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter Notebook successfully, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.9.10 or greater)
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started
1. The project file includes the Jupyter Notebook file, the CSV file, this README file, and a dataPreprocessing folder that contains a python file and some csv files () This directory can be ignored, but it is included because it was used to prepare the data for the project.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your command line interface (make sure to be in the same directory as the project):
	jupyter notebook

3. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the project files.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `VALORANT DATA.ipynb`) by clicking on it.
5. Before running the notebook, make sure you have the necessary data file (`fixedData.csv`) in the same directory.
6. Execute the code cells in the notebook one by one to run the project and see the results.

## Notes
- This project assumes basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- Ensure that you have the required datasets or update the code to use your own dataset.
